# Cricket-Coin-Toss-Data-Analysis

This was a 4th year Data Analytics assignment I completed as part of a Data Analytics module which used Python and Jupyter Notebook. This assignment aimed to explore the impact of winning the coin toss has had across all forms of men's cricket. Data was scraped from the website https://www.espncricinfo.com/ using a custom script I made in python which is the file "ESPN Cricinfo web scraper.py" in this repository. The data generated from the web scraping was inserted into 3 csv files, each of which contains information of each game on record across the three forms of cricket. 

After analysing the data using Jupyter Notebook and Python, I wrote a report on my findings which is the "Data Analytics Assignment Report.docx" located in the repository.
